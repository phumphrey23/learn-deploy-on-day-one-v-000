              <p>If I had to say, I’m a Designer/Merchandiser/Marketer/Educator.  My journey definitely makes me so unique.  I initially went to college for Mechanical Engineering but ended up graduating in Fashion Merchandising.  I got into mechanical engineering to create new things but it was more science and math and less creating.  My first intro to computer science course turned me off from the whole idea of coding. Back then it was just calculating arrays and creating loops in Matlab. Ironically enough, engineering is what led me to fashion.  While at an engineering convention, I got to chance to meet the keynote speaker who just so happened to graduate as an engineer but later went on to found her own fashion brand in New York. She offered me an internship and the first chance I got, I switched schools as a Fashion Merchandising major.  My prayers were answered! I finally figured out what I was put on the Earth to do.  Until my my boss calls me up and ask if I would be interested in managing their newsletter emails.  Before you know it, I’m pushing files to servers and editing html…and I like it.  Suddenly coding was pretty cool but I figured it was too late to go back to school for it. I was able to learn how to design emails and ads throughout my time there an since then, design has become a major part of my life. I love design but, I still yearned to learn how to code.  Flatiron School was the perfect fit for me.  I’ve always been big on education and aside from freelance design I’m also a math/science teacher.  The Learn.co platform fits with my learning style and any place where I can impart what I’ve learned with someone else who’s also on this journey is where I belong.  Thanks to Flatiron School, I will become an awesome Developer/Designer/Merchandiser/Marketer/Educator.</p>
